Read me :

This is a delay inside projects where the data bass have been taken from the MySQL and have been pulled and used at Table to create a dashboard upon the data we have. 

At the dashboard you can see the :
1- time year
2- time month
3- revenues by market 
4- reviews by-products 
5- the revenues by the time the month of the year 
6- top 5 costumers 
7- top 5  products 

All of them can be filtered so that can see the effect on the other part. 

The dashboard can give a live with the MySQL database.
